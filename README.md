Welcome to the **Python Interactive Learning Tool**, a command-line-based application designed to help users learn Python programming concepts, practice coding challenges, and take quizzes. This tool is beginner-friendly and provides interactive learning experiences through structured modules.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Learning Modules**
Learn Python concepts through predefined topics:
- Strings
- Loops
- Recursion
- Data Types
- File Handling
- Error Handling

Each module includes explanations and examples to help you understand the concepts effectively.

### 2. **Quiz Functionality**
Test your knowledge with a randomized quiz covering fundamental Python topics. Answer multiple-choice questions and track your score.

### 3. **Coding Challenges**
Practice coding by solving real-world programming challenges. Write your solutions directly in the terminal, and they will be saved as Python files.

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
Monitor your learning journey by viewing:
- Topics you have learned
- Your quiz score
- The number of challenges you have completed

### 5. **File Management**
Easily manage files created during challenges or other Python scripts in your directory. View or edit them directly through the application.

### 6. **Help Menu**
Access a detailed help menu that guides you on how to use the tool and its features.
